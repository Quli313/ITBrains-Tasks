Hello friends! I would like to share an exciting development with you. I started learning C# language with the free Backend course I won from IT Brains programming academy! 🌐💻

This course is a tremendous opportunity that opens the door to the world of programming for me. Starting from the basic concepts of the C# language, I learned object-oriented programming and began to explore the intricacies of backend development through the ASP.NET Core framework.

I am trying to develop my own projects with the knowledge I gained during the course. This provides a great opportunity to reinforce what I have learned, as well as use my skills in real-world applications.

Thank you to everyone who supported me on this journey. At the same time, I will continue to constantly learn new things about the dynamics of the programming world.
